Here are some important skills for 802.11ax MAC stack development:</li><li>Wireless Networking: A strong understanding of wireless networking concepts, including MAC layer protocols, channel access methods, contention-based and contention-free mechanisms, frame structures, and Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms.</li><li>802.11 Standards: Familiarity with the 802.11 family of wireless standards, including 802.11ax, 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5), 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4), and their respective MAC layer specifications. Understanding the differences and enhancements introduced in each standard is crucial for developing an 802.11ax MAC stack.</li><li>MAC Layer Protocols: In-depth knowledge of MAC layer protocols defined in the 802.11ax standard, such as the enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA), Target Wake Time (TWT), Basic Service Set (BSS) coloring, spatial reuse, and Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) operations. Understanding these protocols and how they interact with the physical layer is essential.</li><li>C/C++ Programming: Proficiency in programming languages like C or C++ is typically required for MAC stack development. These languages are commonly used for implementing low-level networking protocols and optimizing performance.</li><li>Embedded Systems: Experience in developing software for embedded systems is valuable since MAC stacks are often implemented on specialized hardware platforms with limited resources. Understanding the constraints and considerations of embedded systems development will help you optimize the MAC stack for efficiency and resource utilization.</li></ul></body></html>",
